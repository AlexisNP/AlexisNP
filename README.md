Hello, I am Alexis, but I usually go by Joururi on the internet. I'm a front-end oriented web developper, and this is where you can expect to see some of my works/creations/nonsense !

I'm currently working at Polux, a UX Agency in Rennes, France, while also learning the intricacies of the internet at My Digital School.
